# Changelog

## [1.26.0] - 2023-04-05

This version of Rustup involves a significant number of internal refactors, both in terms
of the Rustup code and its tests.

The headlines for this release are:

1. Add [rust-analyzer] as a [proxy] of rustup. Now you can call `rust-analyzer` and it will
   be proxied to the rust-analyzer component for the current toolchain.
2. Bump the [clap] dependency from 2.x to 3.x. It's a major version bump, so there are some
   help text changes, but the command line interface is unchanged.
3. Remove experimental GPG signature validation and the `rustup show keys` command. Due to its
   experimental status, validating the integrity of downloaded binaries did not rely on it, and there was no option to abort the installation if a signature mismatch happened.
   Multiple problems with its implementation were discovered in the recent months, which led to the decision to remove the experimental code. The team is working on the design of a new signature validation scheme, which will be implemented in the future.

In addition to a lot of work on the codebase itself, due to the length of time since the last
release this one has a record number of contributors and we thank you all for your efforts and time.

Rather than list every single merged PR since the last release, we have pulled out
a number of highlights to include in this changelog entry. For everything else,
please review the repository.

## [1.25.2] - 2023-02-01

This version of Rustup changes the signature verification code to continue
accepting Rust's release signature key, which previously caused warnings due to
a time-based check.

Note that signature verification in Rustup is still an experimental feature,
and there is intentionally no way to enforce signature verification due to the
feature being incomplete.

## [1.25.1] - 2022-07-12

This version of Rustup reverts a single PR from 1.25.1 and tidies a couple of internal
bits of code.

In brief, it turns out that our optimisation for `RUSTC` and `RUSTDOC` cause problems
with some tooling which runs under one `cargo` invocation, but expects to invoke either
`cargo` or `rustc` without resetting the environment completely. As such, some particularly
confusing error messages ensued, and we decided to revert this one optimisation while we
wait to correct things in a future release.

## [1.24.3] - 2021-05-31

This patch release focuses around resolving some regressions in behaviour in
the 1.24.x series. One problem, related to accounting for the release of data
blocks in the unpack slab allocator, fixed in [pr#2779], would manifest in the
installer [hanging during installation][issue#2774]. A second, fixed in
[pr#2781], manifested in very early Rust versions (1.0 through 1.7) [repeatedly
having their checksums fetched][issue#2777] despite already being installed.
Finally the heuristic which started warning that toolchains being installed may
not work on the given host was improved in [pr#2782] to reduce false-positive
rate and reduce worry among Windows users in particular.

### Added

- Added the ability to configure the auto-self-update functionality. This will
  be of most use when people are testing unreleased versions of Rustup and wish
  to ensure they don't accidentally lose the test version, without having to
  remember to run with `--no-self-update` all the time. [pr#2763]

### Changed

- We no longer delete the top level of `$RUSTUP_HOME/tmp` and
  `$RUSTUP_HOME/download` meaning that if you have these set up as symlinks to
  another place, or bind mounts, etc. things should work. [pr#2433]
- We more gracefully handle outlier situations with unpack-RAM, panicing less
  often, clamping settings into viable ranges and warning instead. [pr#2780]

## [1.24.2] - 2021-05-05

This patch release primarily exists to work around a
[problem discovered][issue#2748] on some Windows (and potentially other) systems
where a combination of factors, including suspected allocator behaviour, led to
Rustup failing to install certain toolchains. The symptom users observed was a
failure to allocate 1677732 bytes: a chunk used for unpacking very large files.
We hope this is fixed in a combination of [pr#2750][] and [pr#2756][].

In addition to that, we also:

### Added

- SHA256 links on the download page so that you can verify your downloads if you
  want to be certain. [pr#2719][]
- Added `--verbose` to `rustup show active-toolchain` to also display the version
  of the compiler for the toolchain. [pr#2710]
- We now support `1.x` installation channel names for versions 1.0 through 1.8
  by hardcoding `1.x.0` since they lack patch releases. [pr#2758][]

### Changed

- Amended the behaviour of the 'missing components' code so that if the problem
  exists when _installing_ a toolchain (rather than updating it) the message
  is different and leads you to other remediations. [pr#2709][]
- Amended the error message for a missing component so that when you're using
  a nightly toolchain and `rust-std` is missing for a given target, we lead you
  to `cargo build -Z build-std` as a remediation. [pr#2732][]
- Improved the documentation around `settings.toml` locations. [pr#2698][]
- Internal improvements around retrying removal of files. [pr#2752][]

## [1.24.1] - 2021-04-27

This bugfix release [corrects an oversight][pr#2738] in the code we introduced to check for
unknown proxy names. The original change accidentally omitted the `rustfmt` and
`cargo-fmt` proxies due to a quirk of the fact those proxies were not originally
part of a Rust component.

We're sorry for pain this may have caused.

[pr#2738]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/pull/2738
[1.24.1]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/releases/tag/1.24.1

## [1.24.0] - 2021-04-27

This release is mostly a bugfix and quality of life improvement release. However
the headlines for this release are:

1. Support of `rust-toolchain.toml` as a filename for specifying toolchains.
2. Streaming support for large files to better enable Rust on lower memory
   platforms such as some Raspberry Pi systems.

When we introduced TOML support to `rust-toolchain` we expected to see some
uptake but we saw a lot more than we had expected. Since Cargo is migrating to
explicit `.toml` extensions on things like `.cargo/config.toml` it was
considered sensible to also do this for `rust-toolchain` - at least the `toml`
variant thereof.

This release of `rustup` has seen a significant number of new contributors to
the project, and we hope to see many of you again in the future.

### Added

- Optional use of RUSTLS as TLS backend for Reqwest [pr#2517][]
- We now support some corner cases in tarballs to permit unpacking early Rust
  versions [pr#2502][]
- When running `rustup check` we now report possible `rustup` upgrades too.
  [pr#2615][]
- We detect and warn if you try and install on an `x32` system since for now
  Rust isn't hostable on that. [pr#2622][]
- We do, however, support `gnux32` as an environment label ready for future
  support [pr#2631][]
- We now support managing `PATH`s on Windows which contain non-unicode values.
  [pr#2649][]
- You can now name the TOML variant of `rust-toolchain` as `rust-toolchain.toml`
  [pr#2653][]
- We prompt harder when checking for the MSVC tooling on Windows now.
  [pr#2529][]
- _Experimental_ support for `zstd` compressed tarballs in channels. NOTE, this
  does not mean channels will magically gain `zstd` compressed component files
  any time soon. [pr#2676][]
- Register `rustup` with the Windows installed programs list when installing.
  This is another experiment into whether this is useful for Windows users.
  [pr#2670][]
- Added the ability to specify a `path` rather than a toolchain channel in the
  `rust-toolchain.toml` file. [pr#2678][]

### Changed

- `rustup-init` now detects tls1.2 for cURL 7.73+ [pr#2604][]
- Installation now indicates the defaults on all questions [pr#2605][]
- We now support the Big Sur major OS version [pr#2607][]
- You can now specify `profile` in `rust-toolchain`'s TOML form [pr#2586][]
- We now use `.` instead of `source` to better support non-bash POSIX shells
  [pr#2616][]
- We fixed a nasty corner case on wildcarded component installation/recognition
  [pr#2602][]
- Our website now has a favicon [pr#2419][]
- We no longer rely on a broken `mktemp` invocation, this should make
  `rustup-init.sh` more compatible [pr#2650][]
- We now do a better job of reporting non-installable toolchains [pr#2562][]
- We cope better when modifying RC files which lack a trailing newline
  [pr#2667][]
- We are edging closer to requiring a specific force argument to install a
  toolchain whose host doesn't match the running system. This may break your
  CI in future so you should check carefully. The main use-case for this
  capability is the `rust-embedded/cross` project which we are working with
  to ensure this doesn't cause problems in the future. [pr#2672][]
- Support streaming large files during unpack phase. [pr#2707][]
- We report when you call `rustup` with an unsupported `arg0` -- for example
  if you make a symlink or hard link to the binary with a name other than one
  of the proxies. [pr#2716][]

We also cleaned up a number of error message cases, including some on invalid
toolchain name [pr#2613][], a better message when no toolchain is installed
[pr#2657][], and some on component unavailability [pr#2619][].

### Documented

- Added notes about Powershell to proxies documentation [pr#2592][]
- Various updates to the `rustup` manual build process including [pr#2628][]
- Small fixes on how to build `rustup` documentation [pr#2641][]
- We clarified the message around restarting the shell when installing
  [pr#2684][]

## [1.23.1] - 2020-12-01

This point release is mostly to correct a problem where if you installed
`rustup` with `--no-modify-path` then the `.cargo/env` file would not be created
in some cases. In addition, we have rebuilt the macos binaries to correct an
oversight which caused older Macs to be unable to run the new version. If you
encountered a problem with `liblzma` on mac os 10.13 then this version should
solve that for you.

Finally, the illumos binary is now part of the release properly.

## [1.23.0] - 2020-11-27

The main points for this release are that `rustup` now supports a number of new
host platforms, most importantly of which is `aarch64-apple-darwin` for the new
Apple M1 based devices, and that we support a new structured format for the
`rust-toolchain` file. You can find more information
[in the new book format documentation][toolchain-file].

[toolchain-file]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file

It is now also possible to install a particular release of the compiler as a
two-part version number. If you do this, then the release channel will only
update if there is a patch release of the compiler. For example, if you ran
`rustup toolchain install 1.48` at the time of this release of `rustup` you
would end up with a toolchain called `1.48` which contained `1.48.0`. If
subsequently `1.48.1` were released, a `rustup update` would update your `1.48`
from `1.48.0` to `1.48.1`.

As always, there were more changes than described below, thanks to everyone
who contributed to this release. Highlights for this release are detailed below,
but you can always see the full list of changes via the Git repository.

### Added

- Our documentation is now in "book" form. [pr#2448]
- When you retrieve `rustup`'s version, you'll also be told the version of the
  compiler for your default toolchain, to disambiguate things a little. [pr#2465]
- Support added for `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` [pr#2493]
- Support added for `aarch64-apple-darwin` [pr#2521]
- Support added for `x86_64-unknown-illumos` [pr#2432]
- You can now override the system-wide settings fallback path [pr#2545]
- Support for `major.minor` channels [pr#2551]

### Changed

- Significant updates to our handling of `PATH` updating on installation was
  made. Nominally this ought to have little external change visibility but
  it may make it more robust for some people. [pr#2387]
- New support for toml-based `rust-toolchain` file format. This will be expanded
  upon going into the future to add new functionality, but for now the basics
  are in place, permitting you to select a channel, targets, and components which
  may be needed to build your applications. [pr#2438]
- We now fall back to copying files when rename-in-place causes problems. This
  may improve matters in dockerised environments where `rustup` is preinstalled
  with a toolchain already. [pr#2410]
- We do a better job of exiting gracefully in a number of circumstances.
  [pr#2427]
- The `reqwest` backend (the default download backend) now supports socks5
  proxies. [pr#2466]
- If you use a proxy for a component which is not part of a custom toolchain
  you are using then we emit a message about trying to build that component.
  [pr#2487]
- If you try and unpack super-large components which would previously be
  gracefully rejected, instead we _try_ and if we succeed then you get to have
  the component unpacked. Unfortunately this means if we fail you could end
  up with a broken toolchain install. [pr#2490]
- We will recommend ways to recover if you can't update your toolchain due to
  components or targets going missing. [pr#2384]
- If you choose to install a toolchain which is for a different target than
  you are running on, we will warn you and direct you toward `rustup target install`
  in case that's what you meant. [pr#2534]

## [1.22.1] - 2020-07-08

A regression in proxied behaviour slipped in due to a non-compatible change
in `url` slipping in in 2.1 which [caused a misbehaviour][env_proxy#8] in `env_proxy`.
which was [fixed][env_proxy@5591cc7] but not released to crates.io until after
1.22.0 was built.

Fortunately, _inejge_ noticed and provided a fix for us by publishing a new
`env_proxy` and providing us with [this fix][pr#2399].

We apologise for any inconvenience this caused.

### Changed

- Update to `env_proxy` 0.4.1 - [#2399][pr#2399]
- Fixed website copy button and copy space overflow - [#2398][pr#2398]

## [1.22.0] - 2020-06-30

Alongside a significant amount of internal refactoring and code updates,
the highlights of this release include:

- We have switched to Github Actions to make our CI and release process
  more consistent.
- We've invested time in the flow when you reinstall `rustup` atop an existing
  installation.
- We've doubled down on discouraging the use of the internal-development-focussed
  `complete` profile. Please use `default` or `minimal` unless you're trying to
  test/develop the Rust tooling itself.
- We've made a number of subtle quality-of-life improvements around the CLI.
- Added a (provisionally unofficial) snap of `rustup`
- We've worked hard to improve a lot of the messages (error and informational)
  in the tool.
- We've increased internal timeouts and retries in an attempt to improve the
  situation for McAfee users.
- While it's not a change, we've documented that `rust-toolchain` **must** be
  UTF8 encoded.

While the changes spanned around 90 individual pull requests, here are the
main changes and additions…

### Changed

- Fixed various links to our repo and to the forge - [#2173][pr#2173]
- Improved OS detection (particularly darwin) in `rustup-init.sh` - [#2042][pr#2042]
- Fixed bug where i686 installer on x86_64 windows would intend to install 64-bit but
  would actually install 32-bit toolchains by default. - [#2186][pr#2186]
- Increased width of copy box on rustup website - [#2208][pr#2208]
- When updating a toolchain, indicate the version you updated _from_ as well. - [#2152][pr#2152]
- When installing atop an existing `rustup` installation, we will now update
  the installed default toolchain, particularly we'll also try and install any
  additional targets or components specified - [#2201][pr#2201] and [#2339][pr#2339]
- Fixed issue where `rustup doc` wouldn't work with custom toolchains - [#2235][pr#2235]
- In low-memory situations, attempt to unpack more conservatively - [#2236][pr#2236]
- Improved consistency in where `rustup` will auto-install a toolchain on use. - [#2252][pr#2252]
- Try to force strong cipher suites in `rustup-init.sh` - [#2287][pr#2287]
- When skipping a `nightly` indicate **all** the missing components - [#2316][pr#2316]
- Increase timeout for rename retries - [#2348][pr#2348]
- Increased 'sanity limit' to account for MIPS binary size increases - [#2363][pr#2363]
- Fallback to non-threaded installation pathway on 1-CPU systems to improve chance
  that installation will succeed on Raspberry Pi - [#2372][pr#2372]

### Added

- It is now possible to install `rustup` even when there's an existing `rustup.sh`
  installation, and we can install alongside `rustc` or `cargo` without necessarily
  forcing via `-y` by means of the `RUSTUP_INIT_SKIP_EXISTENCE_CHECKS` environment
  variable. - [#2214][pr#2214]
- Added the concept of a _fallback_ settings file which will allow snaps, distro
  packages, etc. to provide a default toolchain for users who have not passed
  through the `rustup-init` managed one-time question set. - [#2244][pr#2244]
- You can now specify multiple components in a single argument in the form
  `--component rls,rust-analysis,rust-src` when installing toolchains - [#2239][pr#2239]
- It is now possible to `snap install --classic rustup` in theory (channel
  details may take some time to settle) - [#1898][pr#1898]
- Added indication of why overrides are happening when running `rustup show` - [#2312][pr#2312]
- Added `riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu` support (note: There is still work to be
  done on the compiler etc before this will necessarily work) - [#2313][pr#2313]

[1.22.0]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/releases/tag/1.22.0

## [1.21.1] - 2019-12-19

A panic occurred if a `rustup update` was run with nothing to update and the
download directory was missing. This was harmless but could have confused some
automation jobs.

[1.21.1]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/releases/tag/1.21.1

## [1.21.0] - 2019-12-19

In release 1.20.x profiles could incorrectly ascribe host-independent components
to the host architecture, resulting in surprising behaviour with `rust-src`.
We have [corrected this][pr#2087] and [added mitigations][pr#2115] which should
mean that as of this release, such incorrect ascriptions are supported and also
automatically corrected on toolchain update.

Due to the large number of confusions around the `complete` profile, we have
[introduced a warning][pr#2138] if you use it. It's really only meant for
developers _of_ Rust, or those exploring particular issues in `nightly`.

There are also a large number of other changes, the highlights of which are below.
Thanks to everyone who helped work on this release. Even if your changes are not
listed below, they are still greatly appreciated.

### Changed

- [Download directory is cleaned up after successful full update.][pr#2046]
- [Bad `.partial` downloads will be cleaned up for you][pr#1889]
- [Force installation of toolchain if install is automatic][pr#2074]
- [Switch to darker colours to improve terminal readability][pr#2083]
- [Attempt to be less surprising wrt. default-host during installation][pr#2086]
- [`rustup toolchain list --verbose` now correctly shows the paths][pr#2084]
- [Fallback environment for non-cargo toolchains updated to match `rustc`][pr#2108]
- [Made human-readable units slightly more comprehensible][pr#2043]
- [Improved detection of armhf userland on aarch64 kernels][pr#2133]
- [Improved error message when rustc is detected on installation][pr#2155]

### Added

- [Added `--profile` support to `rustup toolchain install`][pr#2075]
- [Added `+toolchain` support to `rustup` itself to match proxy functionality][pr#2031]
- [Added ability to `rustup component add component-architecture`][pr#2088]
- [Added clear report when `rustup doc` is run without `rust-docs` available][pr#2116]
- [Added `keyword:`, `primitive:`, and `macro:` prefix support to `rustup doc FOO`][pr#2119]
- [Added retry logic so that `rustup` will try and repeat interrupted downloads][pr#2121]
- [Added `--allow-downgrade` support to `rustup toolchain install`][pr#2126]
- [Added display of previous version when upgrading channels][pr#2143]
- [Added support for local non-channel toolchains in rust-toolchain file][pr#2141]

## [1.20.2] - 2019-10-16

One final tweak was needed to the force-installation of toolchains because
otherwise components would be marked as installed when they were not.

Our apologies to anyone adversely affected by the 1.20.0/1 releases.

[1.20.2]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/releases/tag/1.20.2

## [1.20.1] - 2019-10-16

This release was made to solve two problems spotted in `1.20.0`

- Force installation of toolchain during `rustup-init` to improve handling
  on non-tier-one platforms
- Assume the `default` profile if a profile is missing from configuration
  which will solve a problem where distro-provided `rustup` binaries did not
  upgrade the configuration properly

[1.20.1]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/releases/tag/1.20.1
