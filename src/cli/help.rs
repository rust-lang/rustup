    Many `rustup` commands deal with *toolchains*, a single
    installation of the Rust compiler. `rustup` supports multiple
    types of toolchains. The most basic track the official release
    channels: 'stable', 'beta' and 'nightly'; but `rustup` can also
    install specific toolchains from the official archives, toolchains for
    alternate host platforms, and from local builds ('custom toolchains').

    Standard release channel toolchain names have the following form:

        {PLACEHOLDER}<channel>[-<date>][-<host>]{PLACEHOLDER:#}

        {PLACEHOLDER}<channel>       = stable|beta|nightly|<versioned>[-<prerelease>]{PLACEHOLDER:#}
        {PLACEHOLDER}<versioned>     = <major.minor>|<major.minor.patch>{PLACEHOLDER:#}
        {PLACEHOLDER}<prerelease>    = beta[.<number>]{PLACEHOLDER:#}
        {PLACEHOLDER}<date>          = YYYY-MM-DD{PLACEHOLDER:#}
        {PLACEHOLDER}<host>          = <target-triple>{PLACEHOLDER:#}

    'channel' is a named release channel, a major and minor version
    number such as `1.42`, or a fully specified version number, such
    as `1.42.0`. Channel names can be optionally appended with an
    archive date, as in `nightly-2014-12-18`, in which case the
    toolchain is downloaded from the archive for that date.

    The host may be specified as a target triple. This is most useful
    for installing a 32-bit compiler on a 64-bit platform, or for
    installing the [MSVC-based toolchain] on Windows. For example:

        {LITERAL}$ rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc{LITERAL:#}

    For convenience, omitted elements of the target triple will be
    inferred, so the above could be written:

        {LITERAL}$ rustup toolchain install stable-msvc{LITERAL:#}

    The `rustup default` command may be used to both install and set
    the desired toolchain as default in a single command:

        {LITERAL}$ rustup default stable-msvc{LITERAL:#}

    rustup can also manage symlinked local toolchain builds, which are
    often used for developing Rust itself. For more information see
    `rustup toolchain help link`."

    'toolchain' is the custom name to be assigned to the new toolchain.
    Any name is permitted as long as:
    - it does not include '/' or '\' except as the last character
    - it is not equal to 'none'
    - it does not fully match an initialsubstring of a standard release channel.
    For example, you can use the names 'latest' or '2017-04-01' but you cannot
    use 'stable' or 'beta-i686' or 'nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'.

    'path' specifies the directory where the binaries and libraries for
    the custom toolchain can be found. For example, when used for
    development of Rust itself, toolchains can be linked directly out of
    the build directory. After building, you can test out different
    compiler versions as follows:

        {LITERAL}$ rustup toolchain link latest-stage1 build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1{LITERAL:#}
        {LITERAL}$ rustup override set latest-stage1{LITERAL:#}

    or `cargo` is run inside that directory, or one of its child
    directories, the override toolchain will be invoked.

    To pin to a specific nightly:

        {LITERAL}$ rustup override set nightly-2014-12-18{LITERAL:#}

    Or a specific stable release:

        {LITERAL}$ rustup override set 1.0.0{LITERAL:#}

    Commands explicitly proxied by `rustup` (such as `rustc` and

    Enable tab completion for Bash, Fish, Zsh, or PowerShell
    The script is output on `stdout`, allowing one to re-direct the
    output to the file of their choosing. Where you place the file
    will depend on which shell, and which operating system you are
    using. Your particular configuration may also determine where
    these scripts need to be placed.

    Here are some common set ups for the three supported shells under
    Unix and similar operating systems (such as GNU/Linux).

    {SUBHEADER}Bash:{SUBHEADER:#}

    Completion files are commonly stored in `/etc/bash_completion.d/` for
    system-wide commands, but can be stored in
    `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions` for user-specific commands.
    Run the command:

        {LITERAL}$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions{LITERAL:#}
        {LITERAL}$ rustup completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/rustup{LITERAL:#}

    This installs the completion script. You may have to log out and
    log back in to your shell session for the changes to take effect.

    {SUBHEADER}Bash (macOS/Homebrew):{SUBHEADER:#}

    Homebrew stores bash completion files within the Homebrew directory.
    With the `bash-completion` brew formula installed, run the command:

        {LITERAL}$ mkdir -p $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d{LITERAL:#}
        {LITERAL}$ rustup completions bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/rustup.bash-completion{LITERAL:#}

    {SUBHEADER}Fish:{SUBHEADER:#}

    Fish completion files are commonly stored in
    `$HOME/.config/fish/completions`. Run the command:

        {LITERAL}$ mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions{LITERAL:#}
        {LITERAL}$ rustup completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rustup.fish{LITERAL:#}

    This installs the completion script. You may have to log out and
    log back in to your shell session for the changes to take effect.

    {SUBHEADER}Zsh:{SUBHEADER:#}

    ZSH completions are commonly stored in any directory listed in
    your `$fpath` variable. To use these completions, you must either
    add the generated script to one of those directories, or add your
    own to this list.

    Adding a custom directory is often the safest bet if you are
    unsure of which directory to use. First create the directory; for
    this example we'll create a hidden directory inside our `$HOME`
    directory:

        {LITERAL}$ mkdir ~/.zfunc{LITERAL:#}

    Then add the following lines to your `.zshrc` just before
    `compinit`:

        {LITERAL}fpath+=~/.zfunc{LITERAL:#}

    Now you can install the completions script using the following
    command:

        {LITERAL}$ rustup completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_rustup{LITERAL:#}

    You must then either log out and log back in, or simply run

        {LITERAL}$ exec zsh{LITERAL:#}

    for the new completions to take effect.

    {SUBHEADER}Custom locations:{SUBHEADER:#}

    Alternatively, you could save these files to the place of your
    choosing, such as a custom directory inside your $HOME. Doing so
    will require you to add the proper directives, such as `source`ing
    inside your login script. Consult your shells documentation for
    how to add such directives.

    {SUBHEADER}PowerShell:{SUBHEADER:#}

    The powershell completion scripts require PowerShell v5.0+ (which
    comes with Windows 10, but can be downloaded separately for windows 7
    or 8.1).

    First, check if a profile has already been set

        {LITERAL}PS C:\> Test-Path $profile{LITERAL:#}

    If the above command returns `False` run the following

        {LITERAL}PS C:\> New-Item -path $profile -type file -force{LITERAL:#}

    Now open the file provided by `$profile` (if you used the
    `New-Item` command it will be
    `${{env:USERPROFILE}}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

    Next, we either save the completions file into our profile, or
    into a separate file and source it inside our profile. To save the
    completions into our profile simply use

        {LITERAL}PS C:\> rustup completions powershell >> ${{env:USERPROFILE}}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1{LITERAL:#}

    {SUBHEADER}Cargo:{SUBHEADER:#}

    Rustup can also generate a completion script for `cargo`. The script output
    by `rustup` will source the completion script distributed with your default
    toolchain. Not all shells are currently supported. Here are examples for
    the currently supported shells.

    {SUBHEADER}Bash:{SUBHEADER:#}

        {LITERAL}$ rustup completions bash cargo >> ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/cargo{LITERAL:#}

    {SUBHEADER}Zsh:{SUBHEADER:#}

        {LITERAL}$ rustup completions zsh cargo > ~/.zfunc/_cargo{LITERAL:#}"
