# Rustup: the Rust toolchain installer

![Build Status][actions-default-branch]

*Rustup* installs [The Rust Programming Language][rustlang] from the official
release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta,
and nightly compilers and keep them updated. It makes cross-compiling
simpler with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms.
And it runs on all platforms Rust supports, including Windows.
