Discussion:
    Many `rustup` commands deal with *toolchains*, a single
    installation of the Rust compiler. `rustup` supports multiple
    types of toolchains. The most basic track the official release
    channels: 'stable', 'beta' and 'nightly'; but `rustup` can also
    install specific toolchains from the official archives, toolchains for
    alternate host platforms, and from local builds ('custom toolchains').

    Standard release channel toolchain names have the following form:

        <channel>[-<date>][-<host>]

        <channel>       = stable|beta|nightly|<versioned>[-<prerelease>]
        <versioned>     = <major.minor>|<major.minor.patch>
        <prerelease>    = beta[.<number>]
        <date>          = YYYY-MM-DD
        <host>          = <target-triple>

    'channel' is a named release channel, a major and minor version
    number such as `1.42`, or a fully specified version number, such
    as `1.42.0`. Channel names can be optionally appended with an
    archive date, as in `nightly-2014-12-18`, in which case the
    toolchain is downloaded from the archive for that date.

    The host may be specified as a target triple. This is most useful
    for installing a 32-bit compiler on a 64-bit platform, or for
    installing the [MSVC-based toolchain] on Windows. For example:

        $ rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

    For convenience, omitted elements of the target triple will be
    inferred, so the above could be written:

        $ rustup toolchain install stable-msvc

    The `rustup default` command may be used to both install and set
    the desired toolchain as default in a single command:

        $ rustup default stable-msvc

    rustup can also manage symlinked local toolchain builds, which are
    often used for developing Rust itself. For more information see
    `rustup toolchain help link`.
