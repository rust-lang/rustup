...
Modify toolchain overrides for directories

Usage: rustup[EXE] override <COMMAND>

Commands:
  list   List directory toolchain overrides
  set    Set the override toolchain for a directory
  unset  Remove the override toolchain for a directory
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help

Discussion:
    Overrides configure Rustup to use a specific toolchain when
    running in a specific directory.

    Directories can be assigned their own Rust toolchain with `rustup
    override`. When a directory has an override then any time `rustc`
    or `cargo` is run inside that directory, or one of its child
    directories, the override toolchain will be invoked.

    To pin to a specific nightly:

        $ rustup override set nightly-2014-12-18

    Or a specific stable release:

        $ rustup override set 1.0.0

    To see the active toolchain use `rustup show`. To remove the
    override and use the default toolchain again, `rustup override
    unset`.
