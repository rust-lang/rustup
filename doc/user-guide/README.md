## Building the book

Building the book requires [mdBook](https://github.com/vecna-the-eternal/rust-lang-mdbook). To get it:

```console
$ cargo install mdbook
```

To build the book:

```console
$ mdbook build
```

`mdbook` provides a variety of different commands and options to help you work
on the book:

* `mdbook build --open`: Build the book and open it in a web browser.
* `mdbook serve`: Launches a web server on localhost. It also automatically
  rebuilds the book whenever any file changes and automatically reloads your
  web browser.

The book contents are driven by the [`SUMMARY.md`](src/SUMMARY.md) file, and
every file must be linked there.
