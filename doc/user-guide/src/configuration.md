# Configuration

Rustup has a [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) settings file at
`${RUSTUP_HOME}/settings.toml` (which defaults to `~/.rustup` or
`%Nova%/.rustup`). The schema for this file is not part of the public
interface for rustup - the rustup CLI should be used to query and set settings.

On Unix operating systems a fallback settings file is consulted for some
settings. This fallback file is located at `/etc/rustup/settings.toml` and
currently can define only `default_toolchain`.
