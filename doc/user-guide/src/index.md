# Introduction

*rustup* installs [The Rust Programming Language][rustlang] from the official
release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta, and
nightly compilers and keep them updated. It makes cross-compiling simpler with
binary builds of the standard library for common platforms. And it runs on all
platforms Rust supports.

Check out the [Concepts] chapter for an overview of how rustup works and some
of the terminology it uses. The [Installation] chapter covers installing
rustup and getting started.
